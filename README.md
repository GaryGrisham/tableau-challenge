# Tableau Challenge
I used tableau to analyze the data and present:
•	4-10 Visualizations
•	2 Dashboards
•	A city map 
•	And a story
I took 3 years of October data and combined them into one to show yearly trends by gender and analyzed most and least used stations. 
The report can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/gary.grisham#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0
